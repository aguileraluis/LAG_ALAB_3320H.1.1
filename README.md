# React Page Layout

This React application is a user interface design using components. 

# Starting the application

- To start the application: 
  - npm install 
  - npm run dev

Currently, there are two main cards:

- All Employees Directory
- Individual Employee Card

I created components with corresponding css files and then imported them into the main file named AppComponent.jsx
